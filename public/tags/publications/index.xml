      <description>This weekend, the NRC, an important Dutch newspaper, published an article concerning the influence of major sports organizations (UEFA, FIFA, AFL) on research concerning chronic traumatic encaphalopathy (CTE). CTE has seen more and more public interest in the last couple of decades. This disease has been described to occur after a career in sports such as soccer, football, or boxing: these are all associated with a substantial amount of repeated mild concussions.</description>

      <description>Last couple of weeks, I haven’t been the most active on this blog, unfortunately. I started my clinical rotations, and still had to finish a couple of deadlines for my PhD. Therefore, I neglected this channel. However, I still wanted to bring you a new research highlight of my newest paper. It has been published in the journal of Neurotrauma, and is one of the results from the CENTER-TBI study.</description>

      <title>Research highlight: Cost effectiveness of ECPR</title>

      <description>The first official post in the series of research highlight will be a paper that I recently published in the journal “Resuscitation”. The title of the study is “Cost-effectiveness of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation after in-hospital cardiac arrest: A Markov decision model”, which is a lengthy, sophisticated, complex, and incomprehensible title, as research should be. Let’s break down what it is about, why we did this study, so we could have a chat about it some time.</description>

      <description>This blogpost is the first in a series, called “Research Highlights”. This is a series where I will put my research into context, contemplate on what I did, and why, and most of all: comprehensible for everybody. I have been thinking about this since only recently, and I would like to share some thoughts on why this feels like the appropriate thing to do.
Most of you probably know that one of the perks of being a PhD student, is to write and publish papers.</description>

&amp;mdash; David Menon (@Menon_Cambridge) September 8, 2019  For the last month, I have been staying in Cambridge, as you perhaps have read before. However, last week was a little different. I have been flying quite a lot this year: Japan, Vienna, Cambridge, Milan… But my final trip of 2019 commenced last week: a conference in the former beer capitol of the world, Leuven.</description>

      <description>“Retire me to my Milan, where every third thought shall be my grave.” William Shakespeare
Visiting Milan to write a paper at the Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico di Milano: sounds like the most inspiring place to write, right? I know a professor who likes to come here for a week to write books, or funding applications. But now it’s my turn to be inspired by the city of fashion, the most cultivated and wealthiest city of Italy: the country of love.</description>

      <title>Acknowledging and recognizing scientists</title>

      <description>A recent post focused around the future of acknowledging and recognizing science. One of the main points was that researchers right now are mostly acknowledged on their scientific output, instead of also on their total work as academic. As an illustration, I want to present how the community right now in practice values me as a researcher, as well as how I want to be valued.
Current acknowledgmentResearchers right now are acknowledged based on their scientific output: publications.</description>

&amp;mdash; ZonMw (@ZonMw) May 20, 2019  Yesterday, I attended a meeting organized by the main Dutch funding organizations ZonMW and the NWO, called “Evolution or Revolution”, together with Daphne Voormolen. The aim of the meeting was to have an open discussion.</description>
