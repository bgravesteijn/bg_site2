      <description>The last couple of weeks, I am working in Cambridge. I’m working here with Ari Ercole, and David Menon. Moving to a city where you don’t know anybody can be quite scary. Will you find enough distraction, or will I bore myself to death? Will I drown myself with work, just to keep myself busy? Or will I find a balance?
Deep learningMy main focus while I’m here is to develop a deep learning algorithm to predict how patients will be treated the next day, based on how they have been treated.</description>
